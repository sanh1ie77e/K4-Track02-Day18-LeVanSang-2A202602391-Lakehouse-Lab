"""Path bootstrap for the lightweight notebooks.

Resolves `scripts/lakehouse.py` from the repo root regardless of where
Jupyter / Python was launched from. Used by all NB*/lite notebooks:

    import _setup  # noqa: F401  -- adds scripts/ to sys.path
    from lakehouse import path, reset

Why: the prior pattern `sys.path.insert(0, "../scripts")` is *cwd-relative*
and silently breaks if the notebook is run from the repo root or a CI
runner. `__file__` is stable; cwd is not.
